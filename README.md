# Phaser3 + Create React App template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What's included?

- Everything from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (React, TSX, ES6, TypeScript, no need to install webpack or Babel, ...etc)
- Overlaid Phaser3 canvas with the config in `src/PhaserGame.ts` and an example scene in `src/scenes/HelloWorldScene.ts`
- An example button in `src/App.tsx` showing how to communicate with Phaser3 within a React component file
- That's it!

## Getting started

Clone the project and in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install` or `npm install`

Install all the packages in `create react app` + Phaser 3

### `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
